--------------------

[00:01] Loudly raise your hands.
[00:03] Imperial Blue.
[00:05] Imperial Blue. Why?
[00:06] Men will be men.
[00:07] Men will be men. Okay. Good.
[00:10] What does it make you feel?
[00:12] That men will be men.
[00:15] Anyone else? This side of the room. Yes sir.
[00:17] It's an older ad for Maruti Alto.
[00:21] The song itself was very good.
[00:23] Pundo me jaane kya naya hai.
[00:25] That made me feel personally happy.
[00:28] Very good. Excellent. Made you feel happy. Yes.
[00:31] Same. An old ad. The Hero Honda ad.
[00:34] The bike. The song.
[00:37] Milo ka yaana na. That song.
[00:38] Wonderful. What did it make you feel?
[00:41] Wholesome ad.
[00:42] Wholesome ad. Beautiful.
[00:44] Part of life for the 5 year ad.
[00:48] Where the kid was turning 5.
[00:51] Excellent. What did it make you feel?
[00:54] Happy. I guess like...
[00:56] It's a good feeling that
[00:57] a village is growing.
[01:00] Beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all.
[01:02] Yes sir.
[01:03] This crazy ad where you know
[01:07] BMW showed Mercedes logo spinning at a very fast speed.
[01:10] When it is spinning at a very fast speed
[01:13] their logo looks like BMW.
[01:15] What did it make you feel?
[01:17] So you know I...
[01:19] It was a very ambitious kind of an ad.
[01:21] So in that way I connected with it.
[01:24] That you know it was a very good way to you know linking your brand with the other brand and
[01:27] showing your superiority.
[01:30] Brilliant. Fantastic. Thank you for sharing that.
[01:33] Anyone else? Last chance.
[01:35] Yes ma'am.
[01:36] Series of Dream 11 ads.
[01:38] Dream 11 ads.
[01:39] It's a crossover between
[01:40] Twitter and Bollywood actors. It's very light hearted.
[01:42] Light hearted. Smile. Similar to this one. Right?
[01:45] I saw all of you smile. I was looking at all of you when you were watching.
[01:49] This is a very old ad.
[01:50] When I was in college this was the ad.
[01:54] And it has stayed with me for pretty much a long time.
[01:57] Pretty much all my life.
[01:59] Right? Ads generally give you a little bit of feeling.
[02:02] Happiness, sadness, sorrow.
[02:04] That helps you connect with the ad.
[02:06] And somebody said I will not buy this scooter. Right?
[02:09] Maybe that is a decision or an outcome that comes out of the ad.
[02:14] Ads are essentially stories in a very short format.
[02:17] It can be a 10 second ad. It can be a 30 second ad.
[02:20] But they all help you connect.
[02:24] Storytelling.
[02:26] Storytelling.
[02:26] True or false?
[02:28] True.
[02:29] True.
[02:30] Anybody says false?
[02:33] Anybody who doesn't like a story?
[02:39] What about this one?
[02:43] This is also true.
[02:46] What's the difference?
[02:48] Can you turn that off please laptop ma'am?
[02:51] Unless you are expecting a call or something.
[02:54] Thank you. Yes.
[02:56] A good story can be subjective.
[03:02] Every story is subjective.
[03:06] Yeah. But we all want a good story. Right?
[03:09] You just don't want a story. You want a good story.
[03:12] Is this true?
[03:13] You tell me.
[03:16] Okay. Before we start, I have one ground rule.
[03:21] This is being recorded. Now I am worried because I am going to say some very controversial things.
[03:25] Okay. Anyway.
[03:27] So I just have one rule.
[03:28] If you guys are bored of this session, please feel free to walk out. Grab a cup of coffee. Take a break.
[03:33] You don't need to tell me. Just do whatever you feel like.
[03:36] You are locked in this room with me for two and a half hours.
[03:39] The misery is all yours, not mine.
[03:41] I apologize in advance.
[03:43] My only one rule is don't fear the SFD.
[03:46] What's an SFD?
[03:48] SFD in writing balance is called a shitty first draft.
[03:54] Okay.
[03:54] When you start writing stories or telling stories, you will not be good at it.
[04:00] And you'll write what is called a shitty first draft.
[04:04] Don't fear it. Embrace it. It's yours.
[04:07] Okay. Then you'll write a shitty second draft and a third draft.
[04:10] And slowly you will start forming your own narratives and stories and the magic will come.
[04:17] Storytelling is all about practice.
[04:19] Right? It's like going to this gym.
[04:21] When you work on a muscle, it develops over time.
[04:23] So storytelling is also like a muscle.
[04:26] The more you work on your storytelling, the better you will get at it.
[04:30] Which is why do not fear the SFD.
[04:36] There's no energy. Do not fear the SFD.
[04:40] Excellent. Thank you.
[04:43] Okay. So we are here to learn business storytelling.
[04:45] Why do stories work?
[04:47] They speak to emotion like ads.
[04:51] Yeah.
[04:52] They're memorable.
[04:55] And they create what's called empathy.
[04:57] What's empathy? Anybody knows?
