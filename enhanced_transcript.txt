TRANSCRIPT:
--------------------

[00:00] how do you prepare for a story? And you all know you are storytellers because you told everybody a childhood story.
[00:07] Yes, sir.
[00:08] You say something and then the strategy might not work in that case. It's sometimes a pinpoint that you are saying the same thing. Yeah, which means you have not worked on your story. Sometimes you are saying the same thing and then you say something and then you are saying the same thing. You are getting a new perspective. Sometimes it doesn't go the way you are intending. Yes, of course. So you have to work hard. You have to find another way.
[00:37] There is no perfect world. There is no perfect story. There is no perfect pitch. Sometimes some things work. Sometimes something doesn't work.
[00:46] You have to find your own way. But fear of failure means you are not going to do anything.
[00:52] I am going to miss
[00:54] all the goals where I don't kick the ball.
[00:59] Right?
[01:00] Kick the ball. See what happens. Try something.
[01:04] You have this wonderful group of people.
[01:07] Find a chief objections officer. Tell them I am going to tell you a story. Tell me if it works or not. Refine it.
[01:15] Right?
[01:16] What is the learning loop? Do something. Test it. Improve it. Do something. Test it. Improve it.
[01:23] Learning by doing.
[01:25] Start up a way or something. This software life cycle is also the same thing.
[01:30] You implement something. You debug it. You run it. You implement something. You debug it. How many techies here? Engineers? Am I saying anything wrong? Same thing, right? You keep testing. Your boss keeps shouting but you keep testing. You keep testing.
[01:44] Product launch night in the morning. You are debugging at 2 in the night.
[01:48] What are you doing?
[01:50] Debugging is essentially finding faults in whether the system runs. Sorry, you were saying something. Vishal.
[01:55] Hi, Saurav. So basically,
[01:57] don't you think facts are more important than a story? Sorry? Facts are more important than a story.
[02:02] Facts are important. Because when I was working, obviously you have way more experience than me, but when I was working in this industry, tech industry, whenever you are right there in a convo, whenever you are trying to present a presentation or whatever,
[02:15] all they want is, Bishop, show me the numbers. That's it.
[02:18] Exactly. What is the numbers? Exactly. That's because they want to hide behind it.
[02:22] Right? And not that there's anything wrong in numbers. Numbers are important. Numbers are very important because otherwise, people will say you're faffing. You know, we're not here to become Shah Rukh Khan and tell Kal Ho Na Ho. But the numbers don't register in people's mind.
[02:39] The numbers have to be contextualized. 1947 doesn't mean anything to a US citizen. Right? Let me, let me give you a story to articulate what you just said. This is good. So it was in the middle of COVID. I was running recruiting for Morgan Stanley.
[02:56] We had hired, uh,
[03:00] 2000 people in 2020. We had hired 4000 people in 2021.
[03:05] No, we were going to hire 4000 people in 2021. And I had to convince three managing directors that I need to grow my team. I had 65 people in my team. I wanted it to grow to 90. That is an additional cost of about eight and a half crore rupees. Because I had to hire senior people, junior people, incentives, this, that. And I was sorry to use the word shitting bricks.
[03:33] Like, how am I going to explain to people that I need a million dollars more to build a team that will deliver double the volume, which is not guaranteed.
[03:45] Okay. And I had three, three MDs in three different regions who had given me time.
[03:53] I spent a week prepping this story.
[03:57] Okay. And the story, uh, goes like this. And I said, Hey, thank you guys for giving me the time. And, uh, Mike, it's good to see you join the call from London. Actually, Mike, today's the day when I got my offer from Morgan Stanley 14 years ago. And Michael's like, Oh, congratulations. That's brilliant. Good to hear. I said, yeah, you'd remember the conversation.
[04:18] Uh, my last interview at Morgan Stanley in 2007 was with you. Please don't tell me what you were doing at 2007 and get a complex.
[04:26] Right. Uh, because I was, I was working and I don't know where you guys are. So I told Mike, I said, 2007, you and I had the last interview. I was standing in the balcony of my apartment with this small black phone. And you had called me from Hong Kong. And one of the questions, Mike, you had asked me was, when the conversation ended, he said, you have questions for me. And I asked you,
[04:49] Mike, how many people are we going to hire,
[04:51] uh, in, in Morgan Stanley in 2008? Like how is the firm thinking of growing in India? And he said, Oh, brilliant question. Sort of. We are 700.
